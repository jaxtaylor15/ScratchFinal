            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                In this section of the webpage I am going to discuss all of my favorite hobbies and why I love taking part in those hobbies. The first hobby I want to talk about is watching reality tv with my wife. Ever since we started dating and still to this day we love watching tv shows that keep us intrigued and excited. Some of our favorite shows include: "The Mole", "Love is Blind", and "Snack vs. Chef".
            </p>
            <p>
                Another hobby I enjoy doing is buying sneakers. By no means am I a crazy big sneakerhead, but I like to check out all the latest shoes and every so often I buy my own pair that I'll keep and wear. I have well over fifteen pairs of Jordans and Nikes ranging from Jordan 1s and Dunks to Jordan 13s. My favorite pair is my pair of "Fire Red 2s".

            <h3>Experiences</h3>
                <h4>Travel</h4>
                <p>
                    The first section of experiences I'm going to talk about in this section is about the travel that I've ventured on throughout my life. The majority of my travels happened when I lived in South Korea my freshman and sophomore year because my dad was stationed there for the Army. While living in South Korea I travelled to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bali, Indonesia</li>
                        <li>Yokoya, Japan</li>
                        <li>Chiba, Japan</li>
                        <li>Boracay, Phillipines</li>
                        <li>Jeju Island, South Korea</li>
                        <li>Paris, France</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Sports</h4>

                <img src="Assets/IMG_5201 copy.jpg" alt="Basketball Team Picture">

                <p>
                    The next section of experiences I want to talk about is my life in sports. Sports take up a major part of my life and always have. I grew up in a very athletic family with family members playing basketball, volleyball, baseball, soccer, football, and rugby. I found myself spending most of my athletic career playing baseball and basketball. My favorite sport is definitely basketball and I played throughout high school and continue to play in men's leagues and intramurals here at BYU.
                </p>

                <h4>Relationships</h4>
                <p>
                    The final section of life experiences I want to talk about is the most prominent relationships in my life. I was raised in a family of six kids and I am the youngest. I am still very close with most of my siblings, and have a very strong relationship with both of my parents. The greatest relationship I have is with my wife who I married on Sept. 30th of this year, 2022. She is my best friend and I could not imagine doing life without her.

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>
                In this final section of my website I wanted to briefly discuss the plans I have for my future. I am a sophomore at BYU in the pre-business track and I will be done with the pre-requisites to apply for the Strageic Management program in the Marriott School of Business. I hope to get into that program and graduate in about two years. Once I graduate, I want to get a remote job and be able to travel and work so I can attend law school with my wife. She wants to attend Duke University for law school. Once she is into law school we want to begin our family and start having kids. Once we get there, I'm not 100% sure what will follow, but I am striving to continue to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I know He will lead my family and I.
